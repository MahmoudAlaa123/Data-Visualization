# Prosoper Loan Data Exploration
## by Mahmoud Alaa


## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others




## Summary of Findings

In exploratory data analysis I made visualizations to gain insights from the data such as how the variables which I decide to consider in my exploratory analysis affect the Loan Status
and Borrower annual percentage rate and I found that Current loans is the most frequent one in Loan status , and I know about the Distributions of the APR and interest rate,
also I try to remove the outliers from the Monthly income of the borrower,Drawing a heat map helped me a lot to explore the data and find the correlation between the numeric variables
such as the strong negative correlation between APR and ProsperRating , the Borrower APR have negative correlation with all the features that I choose for my investigation
and some moderate relation ship between the prosper rating and some other variable
I tried to find the effect of employment status and prosper rating on Loan status and to find any intersting relationships between the features that aren't main features of interest
like the relationship between the investors and loan original amount
in the Multivariate relationship we try to find the effect of the APR according to the terms of the loan and prosper score



## Key Insights for Presentation

I selected the visualizations that related to the variables of interest which are the Annual percentage rate and Loan Status
